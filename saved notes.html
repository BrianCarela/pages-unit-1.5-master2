TEXT SHADOW

so the values of the text-shadow that I used to make the outline of my header. are top right, top left, bottom left, and bottom right. play with values to find out which value is which, so you can explain it.


*figure out how the position:relative vs position: absolute works, and why theyre separated in the div and <p> in step 1 project 3 in Dash

OK so the Index Page, gonna change the entire body to be the full image from the header, and have no header image (unless it lines up?)
